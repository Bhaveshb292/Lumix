# Lumix - Open Source Crowd Funded UI Library

Welcome to Lumix, an open-source crowd-funded UI library that is being built through the collective effort of the developer community. Lumix offers a wide array of versatile UI elements to enhance web development projects.

## About Lumix

Lumix is more than just a library; it's a collaborative initiative driven by a passionate community of developers. Over time, the goal is to evolve it into a comprehensive resource for web developers, featuring a variety of React components that help the development process.

## How to Contribute

I invite you to become a part of the Lumix community by contributing your custom UI components and ideas. Whether you're interested in adding a simple button or a complex carousel, your contributions are valuable.

**Getting Started:**

1. Pick an existing issue from the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Keerat666/Lumix/issues) or create a new one.
2. Develop your React component that you believe will benefit fellow developers.
3. Submit a Pull Request (PR) to merge your contribution into the project.
4. Before creating a PR, add your name and GitHub ID to the contributors' section to ensure proper credit for your work.
5. Lumix is also a part of HacktoberFest, and every merged PR counts toward your HacktoberFest contributions.

## Auto Deployment

Every merge to the `main` branch in Lumix triggers an automatic deployment. You can explore the latest deployed version of Lumix at [Lumix Auto-Deployed Version](https://lumix.onrender.com).
